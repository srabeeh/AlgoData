1. 10 random numbers - what are the swap costs?
	Selection sort wins with least swaps, then quicksort, bubblesort, mergesort and finally insertionsort

2. 1000 random numbers - swap costs?
	selection sort wins, then quick sort is lightly above, and the same for merge sort.  Bubble sort and insertion sort are off the chart with swaps.

3.  1000 random numbers - comparison costs?
	Merge and Quick sort have the least comparisons. then merge sort has over 20,000 comparisons and then selection sort with over 40K and bubble sort well over 100K comparisons.

4. 1000 sorted numbers - comparison costs?
   All sorts do well but selection sort has over 500k comparisons.

5. 1000 sorted numbers - swap costs?
   All sorts do well but Merge sort has over 10k swaps.

To do: update with calculated numbers
